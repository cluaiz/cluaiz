# Building Custom WASM Plugins

While your main application (Chat App, Website) remains in your preferred host language (Python, Node.js), you can write specialized, isolated tools and compile them into **WebAssembly (WASM)**.

When the cluaiz Engine executes a WASM plugin, it bypasses traditional FFI overhead because the WASM code runs *inside* the Engine's linear memory. This provides nanosecond-level "supercharged" execution speed.

## When to Compile to WASM?

> [!TIP]
> **DO NOT** compile your entire Chat Application or Website backend into WASM.

**Use Pure CEL (No Compilation):**
For basic 1-to-2 line logic routing data between existing plugins (e.g., passing a query to a Vector DB and then to an LLM).

**Compile to WASM:**
When you are building a custom, isolated tool that requires raw CPU speed or offline processing. Examples:

- A custom mathematical parser or physics engine.
- A proprietary token counting algorithm.
- An offline OCR or image processing script.
- Complex data transformation that pure CEL declarative syntax cannot express easily.

## Compiling Languages to WASM

You do not have to write plugins in C or Rust. Modern toolchains allow you to compile almost any language into a standalone `.wasm` module.

### 1. Rust (The Native Choice)

Rust is the fastest and most seamless way to build plugins since the engine itself is written in Rust.

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

```rust
// A basic Rust WASM Plugin
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn cluaiz_entry() {
    let output = b"Hello from Rust WASM";
    unsafe { cluaiz_host_return(output.as_ptr(), output.len()) };
}
```

### 2. JavaScript / TypeScript (AssemblyScript)

If you are a Node.js developer, you can write TypeScript-like syntax and compile it directly to WASM using [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/).

```bash
npm run asbuild:release
```

```typescript
// assembly/index.ts
export function cluaiz_entry(): void {
  // Logic here
}
```

### 3. Go (TinyGo)

Standard Go binaries are large, but you can use [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) to create highly optimized, small WASM plugins.

```bash
tinygo build -o plugin.wasm -target=wasi main.go
```

```go
// main.go
package main

//export cluaiz_entry
func cluaiz_entry() {
    // Logic here
}
func main() {}
```

### 4. Python / C++

- **C/C++**: Compile using Emscripten (`emcc`).
- **Python**: You can use Pyodide or MicroPython to bundle your script into WASM, but note that the `.wasm` file will be heavy (~10MB) because it must bundle the Python interpreter. Only do this if absolutely necessary; otherwise, rewrite the tool in Go or Rust.

## 4. Step-by-Step: Grouping & Registering Custom Plugins

If you build 10-15 different WASM tools, you must bundle them into a single **Plugin Package** (a Master File architecture) so the Engine can load them efficiently.

Here is the exact step-by-step guide to registering your own custom WASM files locally.

### Step 1: Create the Folder Structure
Create a dedicated folder on your disk. Place all your compiled `.wasm` files inside a `bin/` subdirectory.

```text
/opt/cluaiz/plugins/my-custom-tools/
├── package.json            <-- The Master Execution File
└── bin/
    ├── math_tool.wasm
    ├── string_tool.wasm
    └── image_tool.wasm
```

### Step 2: Write the Master `package.json`
This file tells the engine exactly what your plugin does, its security limits, and how to route requests to your different `.wasm` files.

> [!TIP]
> **Complete Example:** View a fully documented, real-world example of this file here: [**`docs/cel/package-plugin.json`**](../package-plugin.json).

Create `/opt/cluaiz/plugins/my-custom-tools/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-custom-tools",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A collection of internal WASM tools for our Chat App.",
  "permissions": {
    "max_memory_mb": 128,
    "max_cpu_time_ms": 10000
  },
  "execution": {
    "envelope": "WASM",
    "routes": [
      { "method": "calculate", "binary_path": "bin/math_tool.wasm", "entry_point": "cluaiz_entry" },
      { "method": "parse_string", "binary_path": "bin/string_tool.wasm", "entry_point": "cluaiz_entry" },
      { "method": "process_image", "binary_path": "bin/image_tool.wasm", "entry_point": "cluaiz_entry" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Register the Plugin in the Engine
The Engine will not scan your hard drive. You must explicitly tell the Engine where your master folder is by adding it to the `registry.json`.

Open `~/.cluaiz/engine/config/registry.json` and append your plugin:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    {
      "id": "ext_my_custom_tools",
      "domain": "/opt/cluaiz/plugins/my-custom-tools/",
      "load_strategy": "LAZY",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```
*Note: `LAZY` loading ensures the 128MB memory cap isn't allocated until the CEL script actually calls the plugin.*

### Step 4: Invoke the Tools via CEL
Now, your host application (Python/Node.js) can instantly trigger any of the 15 tools inside your master plugin package. The Engine automatically matches the `invoke()` method to the correct `.wasm` file based on your `package.json` routes.

```cel
// 1. Call the math_tool.wasm
let $math_result = use plugin::my-custom-tools -> invoke(calculate, data: "2+2")

// 2. Pass the result directly into string_tool.wasm (Zero Host Overhead)
let $final = use plugin::my-custom-tools -> invoke(parse_string, input: $math_result)
```

To understand how the Engine automatically discovers your plugin folder and reads the `package.json` to load the WASM files, read the [Manifest Architecture Guide](./manifest-architecture.md).
