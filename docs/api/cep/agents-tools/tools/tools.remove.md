# tools.remove

Uninstall a selected installed tool using the existing component installer/registry owner. It is broader than clearing cache and narrower than deleting all packages of a kind.

## Endpoint, execution and permissions

| Property | Contract |
|---|---|
| Wire endpoint | `POST /v1/cep`; logical method `tools.remove` |
| Execution | Synchronous domain result in the JSON-RPC result field |
| Required scope | `write` |
| MCP facade | Not exposed by the current read-only MCP facade |
| Side effects | Destructive; review the target before calling |

Send a Bearer token when API authentication is enabled. Authentication failures are HTTP 401; ordinary CEP method errors are JSON-RPC error objects, normally with HTTP 200. A successful HTTP status alone does not prove the operation succeeded. See [the common CEP contract](../../README.md).

## How it works

1. Validate kind/name and locate the actual installed target
2. Authorize the installer category location
3. Run remove_component and return the target identity

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    C["Client request"] --> A["Authentication, principal and typed params"]
    A --> P0["Validate kind/name and locate the actual installed target"]
    P0 --> P1["Authorize the installer category location"]
    P1 --> P2["Run remove_component and return the target identity"]
    P2 --> R["JSON-RPC result or explicit error"]
```

## Parameters, defaults and value effects

| Parameter | Type | Required | Meaning, default and constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | "skill" \| "plugin" \| "mcp" | Yes | skill, plugin or mcp Required enum: skill (instructions), plugin (WASM/native package), mcp (server package). Kind and name must identify the same installed entry. |
| `name` | string | Yes | The tool's folder name: 1–64 lowercase letters, digits, dots, underscores or hyphens Required package/registry name, 1–64 ASCII lowercase letters/digits/dots/underscores/hyphens; first character must be a letter or digit. Not a path or arbitrary repository URL. |

Unknown top-level method parameters are rejected. `params._meta` is protocol metadata, not a domain option; approval retries must preserve the same method and domain parameters. Where a parameter is optional, omission follows the method-specific rules above rather than implying a universal zero or empty-string default.

## Request examples

Examples describe contracts, not measured execution. Replace IDs, paths and installed-package names with real values from your Engine. Do not execute write/delete/process examples against valuable data merely to read the documentation.

### 1. Basic request

This request uses the documented selection. Read the result semantics below before acting on it.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools.remove",
  "params": {
    "kind": "skill",
    "name": "installed-tool"
  }
}
```

### 2. Remove one installed MCP package

Select a real installed name, not the MCP function exported inside it.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools.remove",
  "params": {
    "kind": "mcp",
    "name": "installed-server"
  }
}
```

## Response and field meanings

kind/name identify the package removed. There is no retained uninstall snapshot or undo token. Refresh tools.list after the operation.

The following response is an illustrative shape. IDs, byte counts, timings and array contents depend on the actual request and machine; shortened nested objects are not a second schema or a measured result.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "kind": "skill",
    "name": "installed-tool"
  }
}
```

## Errors and recovery

| Code / boundary | Meaning | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP 401 | Missing/invalid token while authentication is enabled | Supply the configured token; a CEP params change cannot repair authentication |
| `-32602` / typed params | Missing required fields, wrong JSON types or unknown fields | Correct the request against this page; do not retry the same invalid payload |
| `-32002` / principal | Required scope/owner/root authorization is absent | Inspect `error.data.needs`; use an authorized caller or permitted target |
| `-32004` / `tool_not_found` | No installed tool of this kind and name | Refresh the relevant inventory/IDs and check whether the resource expired |
| `-32602` / `invalid_params` | `name` is not 1–64 lowercase letters, digits, dots, underscores or hyphens | Correct the option/value combination; install required assets where relevant |
| `-32002` / `forbidden` | The tool folder is outside the caller's roots (`data.needs: "roots"`) | Read the error message, correct the backend/filesystem/configuration condition, then retry deliberately |
| `-32010` / `tool_operation_failed` | The installer, registry or tool itself failed (its message is passed on) | Read the error message, correct the backend/filesystem/configuration condition, then retry deliberately |

### Invalid-field example

This is deliberately invalid. The extra field must be removed; it is not an alternate feature toggle.

```text
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 90,
  "method": "tools.remove",
  "params": {
    "kind": "skill",
    "name": "installed-tool",
    "__unknown_option": true
  }
}
```

The error envelope is `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":90,"error":{"code":-32602,"message":"...","data":{"type":"invalid_params", "errors":[...]}}}`. Exact message and field diagnostics are generated by typed deserialization; callers should use codes and structured data, not match a sentence.

## cURL

Save one valid request above as `request.json`:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/cep \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLUAIZ_TOKEN" \
  --data-binary @request.json
```

## Python

Install `requests` in your client environment. This executes the basic request; edit `params` for a different valid case.

```python
import json
import os
import requests

payload = json.loads(r'''{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools.remove",
  "params": {
    "kind": "skill",
    "name": "installed-tool"
  }
}''')
response = requests.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/cep",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer " + os.environ["CLUAIZ_TOKEN"]},
    json=payload, timeout=60,
)
response.raise_for_status()
reply = response.json()
if "error" in reply:
    raise RuntimeError(json.dumps(reply["error"], ensure_ascii=False))
print(reply["result"])
```

## JavaScript / Node.js

Use an owner token only in a trusted client. Do not ship it inside a public web page.

```javascript
const payload = {
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools.remove",
  "params": {
    "kind": "skill",
    "name": "installed-tool"
  }
};
const response = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/cep", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json", authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.CLUAIZ_TOKEN}` },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
const raw = await response.text();
if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${raw}`);
const reply = JSON.parse(raw);
if (reply.error) throw new Error(JSON.stringify(reply.error));
console.log(reply.result);
```

## Limits, state and related operations

This can delete package data and fail on filesystem/runtime conditions. Stop or coordinate active use rather than assuming a live tool call is preempted. It is not chat.set_tools detach, and it does not directly clear every remembered grant. Package locations come from the existing registry/installer and pass caller roots. Relative file operations stay inside that package even for the unrestricted owner; absolute paths, .. and escaping symlinks are not accepted as assets.

- [`tools.list`](tools.list.md): use its separate documented contract.
- [`tools.clear_cache`](tools.clear_cache.md): use its separate documented contract.
- [`chat.set_tools`](../../ai-inference/chat/chat.set_tools.md): use its separate documented contract.
